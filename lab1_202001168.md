### Q2
#### Scope:
A considerable proportion of the human population has some form of hearing impairment. The suggested application meets the unique requirements of its users. This programme enables users to detect various noises in the surroundings.Using their Android devices, they may explore their surroundings.

* Huge library of predetermined sounds.
* Customizable add/remove of sounds.
* Customizable alerts
* Application should be running in the background all the time

#### Non Functional Requirements:
* Accessibility and UI: The UI should be simple and attractive. It should be easily available on android/iOS devices.
* Performance:
  * The application should be easily able to process the sounds in real time.
  * There shouldn't be any latency in alerts.
* Reliability:
